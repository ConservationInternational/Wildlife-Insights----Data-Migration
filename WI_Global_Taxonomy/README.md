# WI Global Taxonomy

We created the WI Taxonomy because we needed a global standard of what we call things (wildlife, objects, humans, etc) in every project, every image, every video (soon!) every acoustic file (soon!) from around the world. Without standardizing taxonomy through Wildlife Insights it would be impossible (or at least really hard) to manage and analyze data from within large wildlife monitoring projects and accross several projects. In a global platform like Wildlife Insights standardization becomes even more important when datasets are coming from all over the world and from many, many organizations and individuals. We leverage existing standards as best we can and will provide mappings into as many standards as possible. 

**Mammals** - The WI taxonomy	follows the [American Society of Mammalogists Mammal Diversity Database](https://mammaldiversity.org/). 

**Birds** - We use [Birdlife International's taxonomy](http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/search).

**Everything else** - We also have names for other taxa (reptiles,insects, etc), domestic species, non-animals (car, motorcycle,etc), names for higher taxonomic ranks when animals can't be identified to species and have various classes to describe types of humans (park ranger, tourist, etc). 


The WI taxonomy will continue to grow and evolve over time. If you have questions about the taxonomy please email us at info@wildlifeinsights.org.

# Taxonomy Tools!
1. The Wildlife Insights [Taxonomy Search Tool](https://wildlifeinsights-taxonomy-ewutmovdfa-uc.a.run.app/).
2. [WI_Taxonomy.R](https://github.com/ConservationInternational/Wildlife-Insights----Data-Migration/blob/master/WI_Global_Taxonomy/WI_Taxonomy.R) enables you to download the most current version of the WI Taxonomy. It will create an R dataframe and also write out a .csv file.
3.  _More tools are coming but also please let us know what would make this easier for you!_
