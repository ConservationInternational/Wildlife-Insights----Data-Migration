# WI_Taxonomy.R
# Purpose- This script will query the Wildlife Insights API and make a copy of the full
# Wildlife Insights Global Taxonomy (WIGT).  All data being uploaded 
# into Wildlife Insights must map into the WIGT. Without doing this there will be no practical way 
# to perform analytics across WI projects and initiatives.

# 1. Import the Wildife Insights Global Taxonomy dataset.

wi_taxa_data <- wi_taxa_data %>% replace(., is.na(.), "")
# Write out a .csv file for anyone wanting to look at this in Excel. Feel free to inspect this file and use it 
# however you need to find what matches the taxonomy used in your datasets.
# Check out the data
View(wi_taxa_data)
# Write a.csv file if you want to look at it in Excel or a text editor.
